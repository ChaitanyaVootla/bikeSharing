## General Information
A US bike-sharing provider `BoomBikes` customer count dataset is provided with attributes related to weather, date, season, year, month, holiday, weekday, working day, and count of rental bikes. The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands


<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The variables like `month`, `year`, `weather situation` are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- The coefficients of the variables like `month`, `year`, `weather situation` are very closely related to the affect seen in the box plots for these with basic EDA which confirms the significance of these variables.
